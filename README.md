# Persian Sentiment Analysis using ParsBERT & Deep Ensemble Learning

## Overview
This project performs **sentiment analysis on Persian text** using a deep learning ensemble built on **ParsBERT embeddings**.  
It first uses **ParsBERT** to extract semantic representations of Persian sentences, then trains multiple neural architectures (LSTM, GRU, CNN, and Dense) on these embeddings.  
Finally, an **ensemble model** combines their predictions to improve accuracy and generalization across different sentiment categories.

## Key Features
- **ParsBERT embeddings:** Leverages transformer-based embeddings for rich Persian text representation.  
- **Multiple deep learning models:** Implements and trains LSTM, GRU, CNN, and Dense networks.  
- **Ensemble learning:** Combines all modelsâ€™ outputs to enhance robustness and accuracy.  
- **Comprehensive preprocessing:** Uses `Hazm` and `PersianStemmer` for Persian text normalization, stemming, and cleaning.  
- **Performance evaluation:** Measures accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and visualizes results with PR, ROC, and confusion matrix plots.

## Model Pipeline
1. **Data Preparation** â€“ Load and merge Persian text datasets.  
2. **Text Preprocessing** â€“ Normalize, clean, and tokenize sentences.  
3. **Embedding Extraction** â€“ Generate dense vectors using `ParsBERT`.  
4. **Model Training:**  
   - LSTM Network  
   - GRU Network  
   - CNN Model  
   - Fully Connected (Dense) Model  
5. **Ensemble Aggregation** â€“ Combine model predictions via voting or averaging.  
6. **Evaluation & Visualization** â€“ Compute metrics and visualize PR/F1/Confusion curves.
